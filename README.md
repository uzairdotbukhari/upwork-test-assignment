# Coding Challenge: React TypeScript Login Component

## Objective

Your task is to create a login component using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. This component should include fields for email and password, as well as a submit button.

## Requirements

1.  **React & TypeScript:** Your component should be built using React and TypeScript. Make sure to utilize TypeScript's features to add type definitions where necessary.
    
2.  **Form Validation:** Implement basic form validation:
    
    -   The email field should validate for a correct email format.
    -   The password field should require at least 8 characters.
    -   Display a relevant error message under the corresponding field if the input is invalid.
3.  **Tailwind CSS:** Use Tailwind CSS to style your component. Strive for a modern, clean look. The component should be responsive and look good on both desktop and mobile screens.
    
4.  **Submit Button:** Upon clicking the 'Submit' button, if the form input is valid, display a success message on the screen. If the form input is invalid, prevent form submission and show an appropriate error message.
    
5.  **Code Quality:** Your code should be clean, well-organized, and easy to understand. Proper use of hooks, state management, and conditional rendering is expected.

-   Code Quality: Is the code understandable and maintainable?
-   Error handling: Does the application handle potential errors gracefully?
-   Design: Is the application easy to use and visually appealing?

We look forward to seeing your solution. Good luck!
